There are five Critical Files:  Here is the list of files that we consider to be critical for an Electronic Raffle System:
1. The RNG algorithm and implementation
2. The files responsible for “Control program (self) verification”
3. Anything related to “Critical memory handling and validation”
4. Source code responsible for “Generation of ticket validation numbers.”
5. Source code related to Raffle Event Logic (i.e. ticket allocation, refunds, winner determination, etc.).
