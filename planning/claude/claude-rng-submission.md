GLI Gaming RNG Submission Requirements
The random number generator (RNG) is an integral part of gaming software. It must be carefully tested to ensure
that it will meet with the technical standards of the gaming markets. GLI has developed the methods necessary to
test that the RNG and its associated logic are suitable for its intended usage in the desired market.
In order to analyze the RNG utilized by your gaming software in an accurate, efficient, and timely manner, GLI
kindly asks that the vendor read the overview below and complete the submission checklist which follows.
RNG Analysis Overview
The RNG analysis contains three primary items; source code review, statistical data analysis, and software verifi-
cation. The conclusion contained within the final GLI report will be based off the results of testing conducted
within the source code review and the statistical data analysis. The conclusion will only be applicable to the RNG
that is identified through the software verification. If the identifying marks change, than the conclusion will no
longer be applicable unless the reasons for the changes are examined by GLI.
Source Code Review: GLI will review the code associated with generating random numbers utilized in game
play. The RNG and associated logic must be understood so that potential weaknesses may be addressed. In order
to perform this area of testing, GLI requires submission of the final source code package associated with the RNG
and game software. In the case that a test application is created to pull data from the RNG, the source code for
the test application must also be provided so that GLI can confirm that it generates data in the same manner as
the production software.
Statistical Data Analysis: GLI will apply a battery of statistical tests to the data generated by the RNG. The da-
ta must be collected using methods that are as close as possible to those used when generating outcomes for
game play in the field. If a hardware random number generator is utilized in the field, it must also be utilized in
data collection. Depending on testing scope, GLI may also collect binary data from the RNG that is not formatted
for a specific game and apply a specific analysis adapted for that type of data.
Example
Suppose the RNG is to be analyzed for its use in drawing 5 repeatable integer values from 1 to 49 inclu-
sive (picking 5 numbers with replacement). GLI would need to be able to generate, with the test applica-
tion, a text file containing 51,000,000 records of 5 repeatable integers per record, drawn from a range of
49. The text file should be in a computer-parsable form. The data generated on each line should be gener-
ated in the exact manner a live game play would be conducted in the field.
In the case that multiple games and configurations are utilized by the RNG, GLI will examine the various games
and determine which test-cases to produce in order to properly evaluate the RNG.
Software Verification: For the final report, GLI will need to be able to uniquely identify the RNG that was
tested. This means that GLI record the key files and their respective checksums (SHA1, MD5, or SHA256) in the
report.
Example
As a basic example, suppose we have RNG.dll which pulls a seed from a hardware RNG. Next, suppose
we have Game.exe which utilizes RNG.dll to generate random numbers in production for the 5 reel
game example given earlier. Finally, suppose there exists Test.exe which calls RNG.dll to generate the
test data described earlier as well.
First, GLI will need to be able to verify that the source code provided for review was used to build
Game.exe, RNG.dll, and Test.exe. In the simplest case, the vendor will send the source code and
compiled files. GLI will then compile the files independently. A checksum is taken of the files compiled
by the vendor and the ones compiled by GLI. If the signatures match, then we are sure the supplied code
was used to build the supplied compiled files. Alternatively, GLI can conduct a witnessed compile of the

vendor’s product and take the necessary signatures during compilation.
Second, GLI must identify the hardware generator seed source used during testing.. GLI will need to con-
firm that the hardware generator is utilized in data collection and in generating gaming outcomes in the
field.
In this example, the report would display the checksum of Game.exe and RNG.dll and an explanation of
the usage of the hardware RNG. The goal of the software verification is to be able to uniquely identify
the tested RNG and its associated source code.
A similar method will need to be developed based upon the vendor’s RNG implementation and system architec-
ture. The goal will be the same. Please do not hesitate to provide suggestions on how this may be done for the
system being submitted.
In moving forward, GLI can begin source code review after a local copy of the source code for the field application
and test application are submitted to the Laboratory.
In order to begin data analysis, GLI will need to have a clear understanding of all the calls made to the RNG and
the specific parameters used by the game(s). The data sets will be based off of these calls. To provide efficient pric-
ing and turnaround time for RNG evaluations, GLI may prefer to review the source code first to confirm that eve-
rything is in order before the data is collected and analyzed.
Software verification will become clearer during source code review.
The expected time to perform these tasks once the testing materials are submitted should be outlined in the pro-
posal. At the conclusion of testing, and after resolution of any issues that may arise during testing, GLI will issue
an evaluation report detailing the findings of the analysis.
The submission materials checklist is included below. For quickest processing, please complete this checklist and
include it with the official submission of the materials to be tested. Any exceptions to submission requirements should
be explained. Once these materials are officially submitted, GLI will review them and a technical representative
will be in touch.
If you have any questions about this document, please do not hesitate to contact GLI.
We look forward to working with you and thank you for choosing GLI.

Yes
No
Source Code Source code shall be final and no longer in test or development. Source code
shall be delivered in full along with the compiled binaries. Source code will be
compiled by GLI and digital signatures will be taken during compile to ensure
that the product being tested is the final release version that will be implemented
in the field.
Yes
No
Final Outcome
Collection Tool
A data collection tool along with source code shall be available to allow GLI to
collect data in a manner similar to the manner in which game data is produced
in the final release version of the production application. This tool must utilize
the same RNG and associated methods that are used to generate live game out-
come. The tool shall allow the user to specify, at a minimum the following input:
 Number of draws/games
The collection tool shall output data in a computer parsable format.
Note: GLI’s data collection requirements are large. Please expect that GLI may
require hundreds of millions of draws, depending on game format. In most cases,
the larger the game range, the larger the number of draws required. Depending
on the implementation, data may be collected in hours, days, weeks, or months.
If there are questions or concerns about this, please raise them immediately.
Yes
No
Raw Output
Collection Tool
If required by scope of work, a binary data collection tool shall be available to
allow GLI to collect output from the RNG prior to scaling, shuffling, etc. The
data collection should be capable of generating approximately 96 million bits of
data written in binary format. Alternatively, the tool may output raw data (un-
scaled) in ASCII format.
