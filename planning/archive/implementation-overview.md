This breakdown follows a bottom-up approach that prioritizes establishing a solid, compliant foundation before building business functionality. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Foundation First**: Starting with infrastructure ensures all subsequent components have proper security, networking, and monitoring in place. This is critical for GLI compliance from day one.

2. **Data Integrity Early**: Implementing the GLI database and audit system second ensures that every subsequent operation can be properly logged and audited, which is fundamental to GLI-31 compliance.

3. **RNG Before Draws**: The RNG system must be in place before any draw functionality, as it's the cryptographic foundation for fairness. This allows early GLI validation of the most critical component.

4. **Core Before Business**: The GLI-certified core components (tickets, draws, winners) are implemented before any business logic, maintaining clear separation of concerns and allowing independent GLI certification.

5. **API Contract Stability**: The integration layer comes after the core to ensure stable APIs are designed with full knowledge of the core system's capabilities.

6. **Business Flexibility**: Business logic is implemented after the certified core is stable, allowing maximum flexibility without impacting compliance.

7. **Admin Before Sales**: Administrative interfaces are built before point-of-sale systems because they're needed to configure and test the system.

8. **Offline Complexity**: The POS system with its offline capabilities is a complex component best tackled after the online systems are proven.

9. **Public Last**: Public-facing systems come last as they have no business logic and only display results from the already-implemented core.

10. **Continuous Improvement**: Operational excellence is an ongoing phase but formalized last to ensure all components are included in monitoring and compliance validation.
