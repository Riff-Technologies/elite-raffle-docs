To design an AWS architecture for a raffle system that meets the specified requirements and complies with the GLI-31 standard, I'll outline a plan focusing on scalability, reliability, security, cost-effectiveness, and maintainability.

### Architecture Overview

#### 1. **Core RNG (Random Number Generator)**

- **AWS Resources**: Lambda, KMS Custom Key Store, CloudHSM
- **Compliance**: Utilize AWS CloudHSM to ensure compliance with FIPS 140-2 Level 3 for hardware-backed RNG. This setup will ensure cryptographic security and integrity.
- **Data Flow**: User requests trigger a Lambda function, which interacts with CloudHSM to generate secure random numbers.

#### 2. **Core Logic Engine**

- **AWS Resources**: ECS or AWS Fargate, EventBridge
- **Compliance**: Use ECS or Fargate to run the core application logic in a containerized environment, ensuring scalability and isolation. EventBridge manages events, ensuring deterministic processing.
- **Data Flow**: Events from the RNG and user actions are processed here, ensuring that the business logic is executed accurately.

#### 3. **Immutable Data Ledger**

- **AWS Resources**: QLDB
- **Compliance**: Use Amazon QLDB for an immutable transaction ledger, ensuring cryptographic verification and compliance with GLI-31 standards.
- **Data Flow**: All transactions and state changes are logged here, providing a complete and immutable history.

#### 4. **Audit & Verification**

- **AWS Resources**: Lambda, CloudWatch, S3 Glacier Deep Archive, QLDB Streams
- **Compliance**: Implement Lambda functions to process QLDB Streams for real-time audit logging. Use CloudWatch for monitoring and S3 Glacier for long-term storage of logs.
- **Data Flow**: Audit logs and anomaly alerts are generated, verified, and archived.

#### 5. **Integration Interface**

- **AWS Resources**: API Gateway, Lambda Authorizers, EventBridge
- **Compliance**: Use API Gateway with Lambda Authorizers to control access and validate requests securely.
- **Data Flow**: Incoming requests are authenticated and authorized before being processed by the core logic engine.

#### 6. **Observability & Security**

- **AWS Resources**: CloudWatch, X-Ray, IAM, WAF, GuardDuty
- **Compliance**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and security measures. Use IAM for fine-grained access control, WAF for web application security, and GuardDuty for threat detection.
- **Data Flow**: Monitor application metrics and logs with CloudWatch and X-Ray to ensure system health and compliance.

#### 7. **Infrastructure & Disaster Recovery**

- **AWS Resources**: CDK/Terraform, Backup Strategy, VPC Isolation, ACM Certificates
- **Compliance**: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CDK or Terraform to manage resources. Implement a backup strategy with regular snapshots and VPC isolation for network security.
- **Data Flow**: Ensure all components are deployed in isolated VPCs with secure connections, using ACM Certificates for encrypted data in transit.

### Technology Stack

- **Compute**: AWS Lambda, ECS/Fargate
- **Storage**: Amazon QLDB, S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- **Security**: AWS CloudHSM, KMS, IAM, WAF, GuardDuty
- **Networking**: API Gateway, VPC
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, X-Ray
- **Automation and IaC**: AWS CDK, Terraform
- **Compliance and Audit**: QLDB, CloudWatch, S3 Glacier

### Integration Points

- API Gateway serves as the main entry point for external integrations.
- EventBridge manages communication between microservices and asynchronous processing.
- IAM roles and policies ensure secure access and permissions management across services.

### Additional Considerations

- **Scalability**: Use auto-scaling for ECS/Fargate and Lambda to handle variable loads.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Leverage serverless and managed services to optimize costs.
- **Maintainability**: Use IaC for reproducible and manageable deployments.
- **Security**: Regularly review and update security policies and configurations.

This design provides a robust and compliant architecture for a raffle system on AWS, aligning with GLI-31 standards and addressing all specified requirements.
