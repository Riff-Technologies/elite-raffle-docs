## Opening Statement
"This diagram represents our proposed ERS (electronic raffle system) architecture, designed from the ground up to meet GLI-31 standards. We've built a distributed, secure, and auditable system that can scale across jurisdictions while maintaining compliance."

## High-Level Architecture Overview

### System Philosophy
"Our architecture follows three core principles:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from raffle logic
2. **Security by Design**: Multiple layers of authentication and encryption
3. **Auditability**: Every action tracked and verifiable"

### Major Components Overview
"The system consists of:
- **Public-facing interfaces** for customers and administrators
- **Core raffle engine** containing all GLI-31 critical files
- **Supporting services** for payments, notifications, and reporting
- **Infrastructure layer** for security, monitoring, and compliance"

## Component-by-Component Walkthrough

### 1. Frontend Layer
**Start with**: "Customers and operators interact with our system through secure web interfaces and RSU apps..."

**Key Points**:
- "Public website for ticket purchases and raffle information"
- "RSU for operator sales in-venue"
- "Admin portal for raffle configuration and management"
- "All communicate only through authenticated API gateways"

**GLI Compliance Points**:
- "No critical operations performed client-side for web"
- "Critical files for the RSU are stored in a package accessible only to the app layer that wraps it"
- "All displays show required information per Section 2.3.1"
- "Real-time raffle prize displays per Section 2.5"

### 2. API Gateway/Load Balancer
**Start with**: "All external traffic routes through our API gateway..."

**Security Features (Chapter 6)**:
- "Application-level firewall per Section 6.2.1"
- "DDoS protection and rate limiting"
- "SSL/TLS termination with certificate pinning"
- "Request validation before reaching internal services"

**If asked about logging**: "Complete audit logs per Section 6.2.2 - source/destination IPs, ports, timestamps"

### 3. Core Raffle Service (The Heart)
**Start with**: "This is our GLI-31 certified core containing all critical files..."

**Five Critical Components in Detail**:

1. **RNG Module**:
   - "Cryptographically secure RNG per Chapter 4"
   - "Uses [specific algorithm] from approved cryptographic primitives"
   - "Background cycling prevents prediction (Section 4.2.5)"
   - "Proper seeding from OS entropy sources (Section 4.2.6)"

2. **Ticket Generation**:
   - "Generates unique draw numbers per raffle"
   - "Creates unpredictable validation numbers (Section 2.3.2)"
   - "Ensures no duplicates within same event"
   - "Handles voiding with proper flagging (Section 2.3.3)"

3. **Drawing Engine**:
   - "Validates all tickets sold before drawing (Section 2.6.1)"
   - "Ensures only valid, non-voided tickets eligible"
   - "Supports both electronic and manual draw methods"
   - "Records complete draw history and winner verification"

4. **Critical Memory Management**:
   - "All raffle data persisted with checksums (Section 3.4)"
   - "Comprehensive integrity checks on startup"
   - "Backup and recovery capabilities (Section 5.7)"

5. **Self-Verification System**:
   - "Calculates checksums of critical files"
   - "Displays public verification hash"
   - "Validates integrity before critical operations"

### 4. Database Layer
**Start with**: "Our data persistence layer ensures integrity and compliance..."

**Critical Data Stored**:
- "All ticket sales with validation numbers"
- "Complete raffle configurations and rules"
- "Draw results and winner information"
- "Comprehensive audit trails"

**GLI Requirements**:
- "Redundant storage per Section 5.7.1"
- "No single point of failure"
- "Encrypted at rest and in transit"
- "Point-in-time recovery capabilities"

### 5. RSU Integration Layer
**Start with**: "Ready for venue-based sales through Raffle Sales Units..."

**Capabilities (Chapter 3)**:
- "Supports both attended and unattended RSUs"
- "Offline ticket generation with later synchronization"
- "Secure enrollment/unenrollment of devices"
- "Complete RSU event logging"

**If asked about mobile**: "Architecture supports wireless RSUs per Section 6.5 with MAC filtering and hidden SSIDs"

### 6. Supporting Services

#### Notification Service
- "Sends ticket confirmations and winner notifications"
- "Maintains delivery audit trail"
- "No critical raffle data stored"

#### Payment Service
- "Bridges payment providers to raffle system"
- "Never touches critical raffle logic"
- "Handles refunds with proper void flows"

#### Reporting Service
**Start with**: "Comprehensive reporting per Section 2.8.1..."

**Required Reports**:
- "Raffle Drawing Reports with complete metrics"
- "Exception Reports for overrides and voids"
- "Bearer Ticket Reports with all details"
- "Sales breakdowns by channel/RSU"

### 7. Admin Service
**Start with**: "Raffle configuration and management..."

**Key Functions**:
- "Raffle creation with prize limits (Section 2.2.1)"
- "Time limit configuration (Section 2.2.2)"
- "Lock parameters after raffle start (Section 2.2.3)"
- "User access control with multiple permission levels"

## System-Wide Compliance Features

### Communication Security (Chapter 6)
"All inter-service communication features:
- Mutual TLS authentication
- Encrypted payloads
- Service mesh for zero-trust networking
- No direct database access between services"

### Significant Event Logging (Section 5.6)
"System tracks and alerts on:
- Service connections/disconnections
- Authentication failures
- Critical memory errors
- Configuration changes
- Remote access attempts"

### Clock Synchronization (Section 5.3)
"NTP synchronization across all services ensures:
- Accurate timestamps for tickets
- Coordinated draw times
- Consistent audit trails"

## Deployment Architecture

### Multi-Region Capabilities
"System designed for:
- Geographic distribution for performance
- Jurisdiction-specific configurations
- Data residency compliance
- Disaster recovery across regions"

### Infrastructure as Code
"Everything defined in Terraform:
- Reproducible deployments
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Automated compliance checks
- Quick jurisdiction expansion"

## Handling Technical Deep-Dives

### "How do you handle scale?"
"Horizontal scaling of non-critical services, vertical scaling of Core Raffle Service to maintain single source of truth. Database read replicas for reporting workloads."

### "What about system failures?"
"Graceful degradation - payment services can queue, notifications can retry, but core raffle operations maintain ACID properties. Critical operations roll back completely on failure."

### "How do you update the system?"
"Blue-green deployments with checksum verification. Critical file updates require regulatory notification. Database migrations are versioned and reversible."

### "What about monitoring?"
"Three layers: Infrastructure (CloudWatch/Datadog), Application (custom metrics), and Compliance (significant events). Automated alerts for any anomalies."

## Architecture Benefits Summary

"This architecture delivers:
1. **GLI-31 Compliance** - All requirements addressed by design
2. **Operational Excellence** - Clear separation, easy troubleshooting
3. **Security** - Defense in depth, principle of least privilege
4. **Scalability** - From small charity raffles to multi-million dollar draws
5. **Maintainability** - Clean interfaces, comprehensive logging
6. **Flexibility** - Easy to add payment methods, notification channels, or reporting requirements"

## Closing Statement
"Every architectural decision maps back to GLI-31 requirements while enabling business flexibility. The system is built to pass certification on first submission while supporting real-world operational needs."

## Preparation Tips:
1. **Have a traceability matrix** showing each GLI-31 requirement and where it's implemented
2. **Prepare a data flow diagram** for a complete ticket purchase → draw → claim cycle
3. **Document your error handling** for each service interaction
4. **Create a security diagram** showing firewalls, encryption points, and access controls
5. **Build a test scenario deck** showing system behavior during various failure modes
