## GLI-31 Compliance Focus

### What Makes This GLI-Compliant?

1. **Hardware-Based Randomness**

   - CloudHSM integration for cryptographically secure random numbers
   - Tamper-evident audit trails for all RNG operations

2. **Immutable Audit Logging**

   - Every critical operation logged with cryptographic signatures
   - S3 Object Lock ensures logs cannot be modified
   - 7+ year retention for regulatory requirements

3. **Mathematical Fairness**

   - Verifiable random functions with statistical validation
   - Chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for fairness
   - Comprehensive documentation for GLI review

4. **Secure State Management**

   - Draw state transitions with integrity validation
   - Sequential ticket numbering with collision prevention
   - Atomic operations for all GLI-critical functions

5. **Access Control & Monitoring**
   - Role-based access with break-glass procedures
   - Real-time monitoring of GLI system integrity
   - Automated compliance testing and validation
